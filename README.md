## About

Maybe this is of those things that would just fade away as soon as I start losing interest in it. Or if my time to achieve reasonable progress are no more further practical. Or maybe I'm just lazy. But that's it sometimes. Pretty well, this project had been on for about two weeks now and I realized there's nothing more motivating than making it official to the public (err.. kind of cause no one really knows this page exists yet) that I'm doing this project.

### What game am I making?

It's crazy you ask! Cause I have no idea yet to be honest. I only know it's going to be an RPG game or a farm simulator. I really don't know! I'm currently just building it's base prototype to make the game possible. 

I already set up the sprite system and the collision physics and created an enemy sprite to begin with. School has been pretty hard these days and I've been feeling dragged by it. So progress might be very slow.

### Inspiration

- Stardew Valley
- Minecraft
- Breath of the Wild
- Skyrim
